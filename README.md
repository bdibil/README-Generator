# <README Generator> 

## Description  
- This project is a command-line application that dynamically generates an OUTPUT_README.md file from a user's input 
- It was built to practice using Node.js filesystem module, and installing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) dependencies like the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). 
- It helps with saving time on generating a quality readme for coding projects
